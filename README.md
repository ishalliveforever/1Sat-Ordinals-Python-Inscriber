2. Click on the "Log in with Panda Wallet" button.
3. Follow the prompts to connect your Panda Wallet.

### Inscribing an Image
1. Once logged in, fill out the form:
   - **Image to Inscribe**: Select the image you want to inscribe.
   - **MIME Type**: The MIME type of the image (default is `image/png`).
   - **App Name**: The name of your application.
   - **Data Name**: A name for the data being inscribed.
   - **Destination Address**: The BSV address where the inscription will be sent.
2. Click "Inscribe".
3. Wait for the transaction to be processed. You will receive a notification with the transaction ID if the inscription is successful.

## Validating Inscriptions
The inscriptions created by this application follow the 1Sat Ordinals standard, ensuring they are valid and meet the necessary requirements.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Panda Wallet is not ready**: Ensure you have the Panda Wallet extension installed and set up in your browser.
- **No UTXOs found for the address**: Ensure your wallet has unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to use for the inscription.
